======> chapitre 1: About React and Next
    * Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks 
      to create fast, full-stack web applications.
    * React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

======> chapitre 2: Rendering User Interfaces (UI)
    * To understand how React works, we first need a basic understanding of how 
      browsers interpret your code to create (or render) user interfaces (UI).
    - When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the 
      browser, The browser then reads the HTML and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM).
    * DOM : The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge 
            between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with 
            parent and child relationships.
